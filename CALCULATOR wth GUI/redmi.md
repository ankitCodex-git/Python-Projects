# Calculator with GUI

For creating a GUI-based calculator, you need to use a library. For this project, I am using TKinter.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Tkinter.

```bash
pip install tk
```

## Usage

```python
from tkinter import * 

from math import *

root = Tk()

root.maxsize(width=280, height=350)

root.title("AnkitCodex's Calculator")
```

## Run the programmer
To open the calculator, please use the following code:
```
python ./calculator_assign.py
```
